<u>Distraction time</u> is working a treat! Taken a couple stretch and walk breaks today, and flicking through Tumblr now to give my brain something to process other than journal articles. I do feel more alert than at this time last week. Still got a ways to go, as I’m starting to hit the wall now at about 4.45PM…my aim is to make it to about 5.30PM before I start winding down.
