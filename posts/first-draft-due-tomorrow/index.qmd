I am S-T-RUGGLING to find the motivation to get going again on my confirmation documents. First draft is due tomorrow, and I have a lot of things to write down and revise after this week's trip to Canberra. But instead I am tending to my blog and browsing Etsy. Ugh.

I'm going to have to pay for this with a big writing sesh tonight. Why do I do this to myself?!
