Finished prepping the outline of my proposed project/studies. Was going to present to a Powerpoint presentation, but I have rapidly come to hate Powerpoint in my short research career thus far. I think my co-investigators will have seen more than their share of the dreaded PPT, as well. So I decided to sketchnote my ideas instead :)

(I'm also going to bring a printed copy of my work-in-progress literature review and research proposal, lest they think I’ve just spent the first five months of my candidature drawing text in speech bubbles!)

Now to pack! O Canberra, Y U SO COLD?!
