I cannot wait for this Sunday. I have absolutely nothing planned, nowhere to be, nothing in particular to do. I couldn't be happier about that situation!

It'll be nice to have one full day to myself to get shit sorted. Most of my days lately have included some combination of the following:

- Set five alarms so that I am well awake by 7 AM. Sleep through all of them.
- Make appointments for "first thing" in the morning (9 AM), to force myself out of bed and into the world. Wake up at 8:52 AM.
- No time to do grocery shopping.
- No time to make lunch to take to uni, or no food to make lunch with.
- No money to buy lunch.
- Survive on water and my personal stock of coffee.
- Remember to do grocery shopping, then make lunch with bought groceries. Only have time to eat half the damn sandwich.
- Pile some more shit on top of my desk at home (more like a repository for my clothes, loose change, letters, bills, etc.)

This Sunday, I plan on getting my non-uni life together. Meal plans, and a clear desk, maybe a photowalk, and finally getting to plough through my rapidly-growing "Read Later" folder. Bliss! Fo shiz.
