![An increasing line chart showing progress and near-achievement of a 10k word count goal.](nearly_there.png)

So close! Though I haven't hit my 10k goal just yet, I have already started the editing process. I'm glad I've got another fortnight to clean up the document. Right now, it's in what I would call a stream of consciousness format. Heh. On the other hand, I'm pretty happy with the sections I have edited, and my core concepts are holding up for the moment (only against my own scrutiny though; who knows what will happen when I submit the draft to my supervisors...).

Word count estimates (without references):

- **TOTAL** = 8,700
- Literature Review = 5,600
- Methodology = 2,300
- Research Plan = 800

I will admit now to the **PhD Tumblr Support Group** that I have breached my "four day work week" pledge from a couple weeks ago, but I just felt like I had a lot of momentum and didn't want to break that up with a three-day weekend. Plus, in two weeks' time, I'll be making a trip interstate to retrieve data, meet with the co-investigators and other important individuals that will (hopefully) be involved in the research - coaches, support staff, etc. Though I'll be bringing my netbook with me, I don't know whether I will have the time or the appropriate facilities (such as a *human-sized screen*) to be getting a whole heap of writing done over that three-day period. Considering the work I will have put into my confirmation documents to that point in time, I'm not going to be too concerned if I miss a few days of writing during the trip.

Progress!
