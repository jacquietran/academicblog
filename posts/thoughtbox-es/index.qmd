A few weeks ago, I happened upon <u>Thoughtbox.es</u> *(edited to add: service no longer online as of Dec 2024)* via [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com) (my go-to site for anything related to tech and productivity in a technology-driven environment). Then, with lots on the go, I promptly forgot about it. After revisiting my "Read Later" folder in Gmail, I re-happened upon the site and decided to sign up over the weekend.

With a small project on my desk at the minute, I'm finding it a simple but useful tool that combines two of my favourite project outlining tools: mind maps and categorised lists :) Two factors that grabbed my attention were the clean layout, and the way the design encourages brevity. Right now, it's helping me lay out potential headings and subheadings for a literature review. Wee! For better or worse, I love playing with productivity tools.
