My university's ethics committee finally decided to approve our project today, after months of back and forth about WORDS. LITERALLY. I can't get into greater detail for confidentiality reasons, but I will say that I jumped out of my seat and made a vocal exclamation when I saw the approval email in my inbox.

I may or may not have said, "THANK FUCK, NOW I CAN GET ON WITH MY LIFE."
