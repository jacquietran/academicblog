It's shabby, but I'm hoping my supervisors read my email and give me feedback on the "narrative" of my literature review and research questions, haha... <em>* repeats * It’s only a first draft, it’s only a first draft, it’s only a first draft...</em>

Now to pretend that my PhD doesn't exist for the weekend! Monday and Tuesday will be spent making sense of the mass of data we just retrieved this week. Work commences on the second draft on Wednesday.
