Let's call this week "Kickstart Attempt No. 2". After a work week that left me feeling upside down, I am determined to have another crack at getting back on track this week.

Thankfully, I have much less teaching prep to do for my classes this week, more uninterrupted blocks of time, and an overdue meeting with my supervisors. Hopefully I can get some timelines in place, because I need that external accountability right now.

Let's do this!
