I've already past the six-month mark of my PhD and have been blogging about it all this time, over at my [Tumblr](http://jaccccc.tumblr.com/tagged/phd). (It feels a little dirty to link to my Tumblog in the first sentence of my first WordPress post!)

You're probably wondering, *"After six months of PhD blogging, why the change of format?"*

It's more or less about separating out things according to my thoughts about what is Tumblr-friendly and what is WordPress-friendly. Though I have strayed from the model many times, I still think of my Tumblr as a place to capture snapshots: in photos, videos, songs; of short quotes and emotional responses "in the moment". I like how the format encourages content generation straight from oneâ€™s stream of consciousness, and discourages long posts (read: posts with more than one paragraph). Both of these things are good for me; I am inclined to overthinking and rambling. On the other hand, the more I blog about my life as a PhD student, the more I find that certain pieces donâ€™t quite fit the Tumblr mould.

Given the test run over the last six months, I've decided to launch this blog, where I will be posting more considered posts about my PhD experience. Iâ€™ll still be posting about the PhD on Tumblr, but you should know upfront that I can be highly personal, emotional and impassioned over there (often all at once). Also, as it is my personal blog, thereâ€™s plenty on there that is irrelevant to my academic pursuits. You have been forewarned ðŸ˜‰
