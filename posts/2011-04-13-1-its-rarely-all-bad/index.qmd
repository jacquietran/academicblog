- **Bad:** Met with my PhD supervisor. Walked out feeling deflated, embarrassed at how little I have to show for 4 months work, and overwhelmed at what's ahead of me.
- **Good:** One of the other PhD students in my office left a cupcake-sized chocolate fondant on my desk, which was the first thing to greet me after finishing my meeting.
- **Bad:** Spent 12 hours at uni today. Most of which was spent worrying about how much I have to do. Ugh.
- **Good:** Came home to freshly baked scones and banana muffins, courtesy of my sister and niece.
