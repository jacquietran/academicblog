    "text": "The Four-Day Work Week\nThis is going really well so far. Giving myself day/time limits helps to keep me focused, even when I’m not feeling “locked in”. Thursdays are my “end of working week”, so it’s never very far away, even if it’s only Monday. This time limit gives me a lot of momentum to get going, and as a result, I feel like I’m being more productive with my time. I’ve been able to meet all deadlines thus far, including the submission of two ethics applications. I am remaining aware of the fact that I don’t even know what busy really means yet, but who knows how long I’ll be able to keep up four-day work weeks during really insane periods of deadlines and external pressures? So I figure I might as well take advantage of these “quiet” periods to keep myself sane :)\nIt’s also a nice feeling to finish work for the day, because I leave it all in the office. During Honours, I worked from home a lot, which suited my night-owl body clock (wake up somewhere between 10–11 AM, get started on work at 2 PM, work until 8–10 PM), though in retrospect I did battle regularly against procrastinating activities (aka THE ENTIRE INTERNET). Now, I quite enjoy the separation of sitting at my office computer to work, and sitting on my home PC for enjoyment.\nAlso…three-day weekend, baby. Every weekend. BOOM."

    "text": "In these early days of my PhD, I have already gained a strong sense that I need to stay on top of information management by developing the appropriate workflow systems that will support my progress and learning over a period of years. The system needs to be flexible enough to meet the major components of the PhD (project management, databasing and data analysis, and written submissions). At the same time, it needs to be robust enough to stand up to the various demands of developing “good research”. That is to say, research that responds to, integrates with and ultimately contributes to the ever-changing, ever-growing body of knowledge; “standing on the shoulders of giants”.\nTo this end, I am pretty proud of my handiwork today. I spent the day setting up a web server and establishing a personal wiki to house my steadily growing database of notes that will be used to support writing projects throughout my PhD (e.g., literature reviews, research proposals, the thesis…). As I become more familiar with the literature, I can easily edit my wiki to reflect what I’ve read and learnt. Given its hierarchical structure, this “knowledge bank” will become increasingly useful as I approach major writing tasks. At a glance, it’s all about structure, which is a fantastic starting point for any piece of academic report writing. From there, I can follow “threads” by doing what I call “wiki-clicking”: beginning on a given topic, and clicking links on that page to a related document to broaden my knowledge of the underpinning and/or relevant areas to the original topic.\nThe workflow systems are still in development, which is to be expected as a newbie postgrad student. But establishing this wiki feels like important progress that will support the management of 3+ years of knowledge building."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my second week of coming in to uni three to four days per week, I am noticing a trend in my concentration levels. Specifically, the 3:30–4:30 PM time slot kills me. I lose focus as people around me start getting ready to close up shop for the day. However, as a late riser, I only really get going at about 10 AM, and so I arrive to the office later than others who start up at 8 AM or even earlier than that. At this early stage of my PhD, it hasn’t been detrimental to leave “early” at 4–5 PM, but I leave feeling as if I haven’t put in a full day’s work.\nA couple of things this indicates or reinforces for me:\n\nThe traditional notion of putting in 9–5, Monday to Friday, does not suit me. If keeping to my natural sleep patterns, I go to bed somewhere between 12 AM and 2 AM, and will wake up eight hours later. So my general plan is to aim to get into the office at around 10 AM, and I am hoping to average four days a week at the office / working on my PhD (with some flexibility to increase working days per week during periods leading up to important deadlines).\nOver the last two years of uni, I noticed that I was more productive at night. However, I am becoming increasingly reluctant to work from home because I feel like keeping my PhD life at uni will help me make healthy choices with regard to my time (separating time for me from time for work). During Honours, I predominantly worked from home, which suited my two daily productivity cycles, as I often pushed out a lot of my best work around 11 AM to 3 PM, and 8 PM onwards. Will have to make a compromise in this area, as my aim throughout the next three years is to manage my time well enough to get the work done in three years (and not any longer), while also having time for social activities.\nAfter spending nearly a year completely away from the academic environment, I am still getting to grips with what is required in terms of everyday mental effort. I seem to be getting about 4–5 hours of solid work out of any given day. Hopefully this will continue to improve, or else I’ll have to figure out a way to be much more efficient during my limited “focus hours”.\nI love naps, and that mid-afternoon time is prime for napping. When I worked from home during Honours, I allowed myself many afternoon naps, but it’s not an option when working from the office. Coffee doesn’t help here, so the napping difficulties may be explained by my habitual coffee drinking…\n\nAnd some potential strategies to deal with my 3.30-itis:\n\nBlock out this time to handle things that require small amounts of my concentration for short periods, e.g. responding to and organising emails, organising my workspace, updating mind maps and action plans.\nDesignate this period for physical activity: go through my stretching routine, go for a walk, etc.\nDrawing from a suggestion on the Zen Habits blog, designate this period as “distraction time” (which is what I am practising right now!). Blogging, getting up to speed across the social networks, etc."

    "text": "Now into February, things are going well so far. Ethics has been submitted for the project, and we should hopefully be able to get that approved so we’re ready to look at data in March. And aside from last week’s small hiccup (falling ill and missing two scheduled work days), I’m feeling pretty motivated, interested, and productive.\nSince I last blogged about my productivity levels, I feel like I’ve definitely improved. At the end of 2010, I felt as though I was struggling to get through 4–5 hours of productive work in a day. Now, I feel like I’m averaging 6 productive hours per day quite easily. My original intention was to schedule my days so that I wake up late (with my normal sleep cycle I wake up naturally around 8:30–9 AM) and roll up to uni at around 10 AM. Right now, my days are pretty consistently 10 AM–5 PM, though I had plans to compensate for my later start time with a later finishing time. However, I am having a bit of a struggle maintaining focus as 5 PM rolls around, as the people around me (within my office and also in the other offices nearby) begin to clock off. So I’ve been questioning my original stance, and have come to the conclusion that 10 AM–5 PM is just fine for now. Staying until 6–6:30PM for the sake of it wouldn’t achieve anything.\nWith the (mostly) lovely summer weather we’ve had over the past few weeks, I’ve also taken the liberty to wander away from my desk for short but regular breaks, and this is definitely helping me stay on task when I do sit down to work."

(p.s., thank you to everyone who sent their congratulations!)\non trial: four-day work weeks. inspired by tim ferrriss, inventor and proponent of the “four-hour work week”. while i think that target is a bit extreme and unrealistic for my purposes, the premise of my four-day week remains the same. my aim is to:\n\navoid burnout\nallocate plenty of time for my personal life, away from uni- and work-related engagements\nencourage efficiency and productivity by training myself to better understand “performance over presence”\n\ni have been intrigued by the four-hour work week since i got my hands dirty in a lot of productivity resources last year, during honours. a lot of the work in this area is about making more money with less time-effort, which is an angle that probably moves a lot of books from shelves. but my primary interest is in maintaining life balance.\ni’ve known for years that i am passionate about pursuing sport science as a career. but what i learnt last year was that that passion can also be destructive, either in a professional sense or with respect to the broader picture of the rest of my life. when you love your work, it’s really easy to convince yourself that maybe an extra hour or two of work, late into the night, will do your project a world of good. or that you don’t deserve to enjoy a night out because you haven’t met your weekly goals. or that you should sacrifice time from every other area of your life to meet your career demands. but oftentimes, these compromises don’t improve your work; i found myself producing sub-par writing, spending long stretches of time procrastinating, and feeling less than fit and healthy.\nnothing is cut and dry, of course, and i’m not saying that i won’t ever work six-day weeks, or ever pull another all-nighter again. what i am saying is that i want to achieve more balance. i want to get the most out of my work time, so that i can fully enjoy my time away from it. those who are more ahead of the game than me may have their reservations, but i believe i can make four-day work weeks successful for me over the next few years.\nhere we go!"

    "text": "I’ve already past the six-month mark of my PhD and have been blogging about it all this time, over at my Tumblr. (It feels a little dirty to link to my Tumblog in the first sentence of my first WordPress post!)\nYou’re probably wondering, “After six months of PhD blogging, why the change of format?”\nIt’s more or less about separating out things according to my thoughts about what is Tumblr-friendly and what is WordPress-friendly. Though I have strayed from the model many times, I still think of my Tumblr as a place to capture snapshots: in photos, videos, songs; of short quotes and emotional responses “in the moment”. I like how the format encourages content generation straight from one’s stream of consciousness, and discourages long posts (read: posts with more than one paragraph). Both of these things are good for me; I am inclined to overthinking and rambling. On the other hand, the more I blog about my life as a PhD student, the more I find that certain pieces don’t quite fit the Tumblr mould.\nGiven the test run over the last six months, I’ve decided to launch this blog, where I will be posting more considered posts about my PhD experience. I’ll still be posting about the PhD on Tumblr, but you should know upfront that I can be highly personal, emotional and impassioned over there (often all at once). Also, as it is my personal blog, there’s plenty on there that is irrelevant to my academic pursuits. You have been forewarned 😉"
