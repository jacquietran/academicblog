    "text": "A cropped screenshot from the Thoughtbox.es website\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I happened upon Thoughtbox.es (edited to add: service no longer online as of Dec 2024) via Lifehacker (my go-to site for anything related to tech and productivity in a technology-driven environment). Then, with lots on the go, I promptly forgot about it. After revisiting my “Read Later” folder in Gmail, I re-happened upon the site and decided to sign up over the weekend.\nWith a small project on my desk at the minute, I’m finding it a simple but useful tool that combines two of my favourite project outlining tools: mind maps and categorised lists :) Two factors that grabbed my attention were the clean layout, and the way the design encourages brevity. Right now, it’s helping me lay out potential headings and subheadings for a literature review. Wee! For better or worse, I love playing with productivity tools."

    "text": "It’s a nice feeling to take those scary-but-fun first steps into something new. The feeling is the same for me every time, no matter the domain, the task, the environment… Like singing in front of an audience for the first time, or teaching my first undergraduate class, or running my first true data collection sessions.\nToday, I delivered my first guest lecture. It went pretty well, I think! So now I can say that I’ve lectured to undergrads at a major Australian university. Cool but weird! Especially when I think back to being an undergrad myself, sitting in lecture theatres, trying not to fall asleep…and that was only back in 2008 :) Though it hasn’t even been three years since graduating with my Bachelor’s degree, I feel pretty far removed from that time in my life. I feel like I’ve come a long way in a short amount of time.\nOne of the really great things about continuing into postgraduate education are the opportunities that come about to get involved. There were definitely times during undergrad where I questioned whether I was learning in the best environment, studying at the best uni for my profession. But since Honours, I’ve done more fun and engaging career-related work than at any time before. Importantly, I’ve discovered that I am right where I want to be and where I should be.\nNot only is it great to be able to volunteer myself for various activities around the school, faculty, and university, but it’s so flattering to be asked to take part. I still think of myself as a lowly student, with a little knowledge but so much more to learn. I often forget that I’m already a qualified professional with valuable skills and competencies. Today was a great day and a great way to be reminded of how far I’ve come."

    "text": "It’s fair to say that I haven’t been as productive as I would have liked this week. A couple things that have happened this week:\n\nI’ve been sleeping 10+ hours per night, and have finding it a bit more difficult than usual to wake up in the mornings. For me, this isn’t really too worrying as I am a heavy sleeper and always find it hard in the mornings (inb4 #TWSS). But my sleep behaviour this week is a little bit out of the ordinary, as I have generally been in bed before midnight, which is early for me, and don’t feel as though I am sick or exhausted or run-down in any way. I have a feeling that it’s related to a change in my training cycle this month, with more moderate- and high-intensity sessions, so it could just be my body adapting to this new cycle and recovering from training.\nThe consequence of my sleeping marathons this week was that I just didn’t spend a whole lot of time at uni. After dragging myself out of bed, having breakfast, and finally leaving home, I arrived at uni somewhere around 11 AM–12 PM every day this week. Ordinarily, I would have just extended my day at the other end, perhaps working until 7 PM or so. However, I’ve had a lot of weeknight engagements this week so I’ve been knocking off at 5ish, feeling a little guilty and unfulfilled from the small amount of work I’ve been getting through.\n\nI’m also at a stage where the work in front of me is not my favourite work…reading and annotating articles until FOREVER. It’s a necessary part of any research, but that doesn’t make it more fun for me. Like it or lump it, it’s just something I have to keep pushing myself to do.\nI’ve also had a few other things on my mind that have distracted me this week. Next week will likely be shortened as I’m roadtripping it to finish off February :) To make up for lost time, I’’’ll be dropping in tomorrow for a Friday afternoon at uni (that’s my flexible Friday coming in handy in my 4-day workweek), and may also drop in on Saturday morning as well."

Thursdays are my “end of working week”, so it’s never very far away, even if it’s only Monday. This time limit gives me a lot of momentum to get going, and as a result, I feel like I’m being more productive with my time. I’ve been able to meet all deadlines thus far, including the submission of two ethics applications. I am remaining aware of the fact that I don’t even know what busy really means yet, but who knows how long I’ll be able to keep up four-day work weeks during really insane periods of deadlines and external pressures? So I figure I might as well take advantage of these “quiet” periods to keep myself sane :)\nIt’s also a nice feeling to finish work for the day, because I leave it all in the office. During Honours, I worked from home a lot, which suited my night-owl body clock (wake up somewhere between 10–11 AM, get started on work at 2 PM, work until 8–10 PM), though in retrospect I did battle regularly against procrastinating activities (aka THE ENTIRE INTERNET). Now, I quite enjoy the separation of sitting at my office computer to work, and sitting on my home PC for enjoyment.\nAlso…three-day weekend, baby. Every weekend. BOOM."

    "text": "In these early days of my PhD, I have already gained a strong sense that I need to stay on top of information management by developing the appropriate workflow systems that will support my progress and learning over a period of years. The system needs to be flexible enough to meet the major components of the PhD (project management, databasing and data analysis, and written submissions). At the same time, it needs to be robust enough to stand up to the various demands of developing “good research”. That is to say, research that responds to, integrates with and ultimately contributes to the ever-changing, ever-growing body of knowledge; “standing on the shoulders of giants”.\nTo this end, I am pretty proud of my handiwork today. I spent the day setting up a web server and establishing a personal wiki to house my steadily growing database of notes that will be used to support writing projects throughout my PhD (e.g., literature reviews, research proposals, the thesis…). As I become more familiar with the literature, I can easily edit my wiki to reflect what I’ve read and learnt. Given its hierarchical structure, this “knowledge bank” will become increasingly useful as I approach major writing tasks. At a glance, it’s all about structure, which is a fantastic starting point for any piece of academic report writing. From there, I can follow “threads” by doing what I call “wiki-clicking”: beginning on a given topic, and clicking links on that page to a related document to broaden my knowledge of the underpinning and/or relevant areas to the original topic.\nThe workflow systems are still in development, which is to be expected as a newbie postgrad student. But establishing this wiki feels like important progress that will support the management of 3+ years of knowledge building."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my second week of coming in to uni three to four days per week, I am noticing a trend in my concentration levels. Specifically, the 3:30–4:30 PM time slot kills me. I lose focus as people around me start getting ready to close up shop for the day. However, as a late riser, I only really get going at about 10 AM, and so I arrive to the office later than others who start up at 8 AM or even earlier than that. At this early stage of my PhD, it hasn’t been detrimental to leave “early” at 4–5 PM, but I leave feeling as if I haven’t put in a full day’s work.\nA couple of things this indicates or reinforces for me:\n\nThe traditional notion of putting in 9–5, Monday to Friday, does not suit me. If keeping to my natural sleep patterns, I go to bed somewhere between 12 AM and 2 AM, and will wake up eight hours later. So my general plan is to aim to get into the office at around 10 AM, and I am hoping to average four days a week at the office / working on my PhD (with some flexibility to increase working days per week during periods leading up to important deadlines).\nOver the last two years of uni, I noticed that I was more productive at night. However, I am becoming increasingly reluctant to work from home because I feel like keeping my PhD life at uni will help me make healthy choices with regard to my time (separating time for me from time for work). During Honours, I predominantly worked from home, which suited my two daily productivity cycles, as I often pushed out a lot of my best work around 11 AM to 3 PM, and 8 PM onwards. Will have to make a compromise in this area, as my aim throughout the next three years is to manage my time well enough to get the work done in three years (and not any longer), while also having time for social activities.\nAfter spending nearly a year completely away from the academic environment, I am still getting to grips with what is required in terms of everyday mental effort. I seem to be getting about 4–5 hours of solid work out of any given day. Hopefully this will continue to improve, or else I’ll have to figure out a way to be much more efficient during my limited “focus hours”.\nI love naps, and that mid-afternoon time is prime for napping. When I worked from home during Honours, I allowed myself many afternoon naps, but it’s not an option when working from the office. Coffee doesn’t help here, so the napping difficulties may be explained by my habitual coffee drinking…\n\nAnd some potential strategies to deal with my 3.30-itis:\n\nBlock out this time to handle things that require small amounts of my concentration for short periods, e.g. responding to and organising emails, organising my workspace, updating mind maps and action plans.\nDesignate this period for physical activity: go through my stretching routine, go for a walk, etc.\nDrawing from a suggestion on the Zen Habits blog, designate this period as “distraction time” (which is what I am practising right now!). Blogging, getting up to speed across the social networks, etc."

    "text": "Home on a Saturday night. * insert contented sigh here *\nThe last two weeks have been all kinds of hectic. Consequently, my body and mind are eternally grateful for this break from the madness, thank you very much. The calendar screen grab I posted last Sunday was, regrettably, accurate to how my week actually turned out. I was barely able to find time to breathe between teaching commitments, helping out an Honours student with data collection, teaching, meetings, karate, teaching, and work. And the PhD, you ask? To you sir, I say “What PhD?!” (Which is to say, I pushed my research forward by zero arbitrary research development units this week. What PhD, indeed…)\nOf course, I have paid for my insolence by waking up exhausted after two 2-hour naps today. The wurst.\n\n\n\nA dancing wurst. I wish I had the energy of this wurst. (Image from Vector Portal)\n\n\nStill, I remain grateful and excited about my PhD. It’s been 4.5 months since I started, and while I’m not where I thought I would be by now, I think things are still tracking well. Ethics approval has finally come through from my university, so we can press ahead to data retrieval and data analysis. I embraced my nerd-dom long ago, so I have no reservations in saying that this is easily the most exciting part of research. As a biomechanist-in-training, I am a data fiend. However, it can be a tenuous relationship; ask me sometime about prepping triaxial acceleration data from two measures for 500+ movement trials. Yeah. That said, working with data is still the best part of it all - it’s where the findings wait to be found, sneaky and hidden. And when they’re discovered, there’s that brief sense of a pioneer, of seeing new land on the horizon, of seeing something no one has ever seen or thought to measure.\nLater, you delve into the literature, buoyed by your groundbreaking findings, only to discover that it’s all been done. Back in 1996, even. Devo*. (This has never happened to me, clearly.) Nonetheless, that “land ho!” moment, though fleeting, is one to savour.\nBut enough rhapsodising. Saturday night is for make-shift cubby houses, a beanbag, and The Little Stevies on my iPod.\nHope you’re having a grand weekend :)\n* For the non-Australians following my blog, “devo” = devastated. Not the band."

And aside from last week’s small hiccup (falling ill and missing two scheduled work days), I’m feeling pretty motivated, interested, and productive.\nSince I last blogged about my productivity levels, I feel like I’ve definitely improved. At the end of 2010, I felt as though I was struggling to get through 4–5 hours of productive work in a day. Now, I feel like I’m averaging 6 productive hours per day quite easily. My original intention was to schedule my days so that I wake up late (with my normal sleep cycle I wake up naturally around 8:30–9 AM) and roll up to uni at around 10 AM. Right now, my days are pretty consistently 10 AM–5 PM, though I had plans to compensate for my later start time with a later finishing time. However, I am having a bit of a struggle maintaining focus as 5 PM rolls around, as the people around me (within my office and also in the other offices nearby) begin to clock off. So I’ve been questioning my original stance, and have come to the conclusion that 10 AM–5 PM is just fine for now. Staying until 6–6:30PM for the sake of it wouldn’t achieve anything.\nWith the (mostly) lovely summer weather we’ve had over the past few weeks, I’ve also taken the liberty to wander away from my desk for short but regular breaks, and this is definitely helping me stay on task when I do sit down to work."

(p.s., thank you to everyone who sent their congratulations!)\non trial: four-day work weeks. inspired by tim ferrriss, inventor and proponent of the “four-hour work week”. while i think that target is a bit extreme and unrealistic for my purposes, the premise of my four-day week remains the same. my aim is to:\n\navoid burnout\nallocate plenty of time for my personal life, away from uni- and work-related engagements\nencourage efficiency and productivity by training myself to better understand “performance over presence”\n\ni have been intrigued by the four-hour work week since i got my hands dirty in a lot of productivity resources last year, during honours. a lot of the work in this area is about making more money with less time-effort, which is an angle that probably moves a lot of books from shelves. but my primary interest is in maintaining life balance.\ni’ve known for years that i am passionate about pursuing sport science as a career. but what i learnt last year was that that passion can also be destructive, either in a professional sense or with respect to the broader picture of the rest of my life. when you love your work, it’s really easy to convince yourself that maybe an extra hour or two of work, late into the night, will do your project a world of good. or that you don’t deserve to enjoy a night out because you haven’t met your weekly goals. or that you should sacrifice time from every other area of your life to meet your career demands. but oftentimes, these compromises don’t improve your work; i found myself producing sub-par writing, spending long stretches of time procrastinating, and feeling less than fit and healthy.\nnothing is cut and dry, of course, and i’m not saying that i won’t ever work six-day weeks, or ever pull another all-nighter again. what i am saying is that i want to achieve more balance. i want to get the most out of my work time, so that i can fully enjoy my time away from it. those who are more ahead of the game than me may have their reservations, but i believe i can make four-day work weeks successful for me over the next few years.\nhere we go!"

    "text": "Fortunate enough to know what work I want to do. Fortunate to be in a position (financially, socioeconomically, and educationally speaking) where I can pursue, on a full-time basis, work that engages me. Fortunate to be good enough at this work to meet my personal standards. Most days, I feel awfully lucky to be in the position I am in.\nBut something that has confused me for a long time is the way I can feel so passionately about two very different streams in my life: 1) my creative pursuits, and 2) my work as a developing sport scientist. In my mind, I’ve always separated out these two supposedly disparate branches, without really giving thought to the opportunities for the two to come together and create something even greater. Because really, how natural does it feel to think about music and sport, compared to music or sport?\nAt 15 or 16, I decided sport science was what I wanted to do. I came to the realisation that sport science was an area of study that I found intellectually-stimulating, socially-relevant, and aligned with my interest and involvement in sports. A part of me also concluded that chasing this dream meant giving up another. You know that dream so many of us have of becoming rock stars? Or in my case, a songwriter, or composer, or session musician, or simply a music-maker by any other name? I gave up on those distant possibilities to set sail towards becoming a sport scientist. It’s not a decision I made lightly, but also not a decision I’ve ever regretted because I always saw my dual passions as mutually exclusive. I knew that, one day, I would have to choose one favourite between my two children, so to speak ;)\nNow at 22 and wading through the early stages of a PhD in sports performance analysis, I am starting to make the mental link between my life as a scientist and a student, and my life as a creative. Almost everyday, and certainly every week, I am learning more about how I learn. And in every instance, the relationship between my creative side and my scientific side becomes clearer. I am now beginning to conceptualise the co-existence of my two great loves.\nAt this stage, the lean is towards how my creative side supports and actually underpins most all of the academic work I do. (Consequently, it makes me excited that I might someday figure out how my scientific and scholarly pursuits inform me as a creative!) I am establishing systems to support my achievement of Great Work. What I am noticing is my blatant attraction to that which can help me complete Great Work efficiently, while also being visually stunning, creatively inspiring, and emotionally connected to my self-concept.\nI also find that I am becoming less interested in what people in my own field do to become (or be considered) “successful”. More often, I gravitate towards the stories and journeys of writers, poets, designers, painters, musicians, photographers. I relate far more to these artists, these observers of the human spirit and condition, than I do to your typical straight-line, no-nonsense scholar or academic.\nMore on specific workflows and inspirations in blog posts to come, but I just felt compelled to write about what I feel is an emerging relationship between my personal artistry and scientific study. Consider it the influence of my muse dropping by for a late night visit. :)"

The difficulty for me is not getting organised, but staying organised.\nLately, I’ve been lamely accepting barriers to staying organised. Here are some of my enlightened thoughts on the topic from the past week:\n\n“I’m feeling sick.” “I can’t be bothered.” “I’ll leave it until next week.” “It’s not as important as I think it is.” “I’m wasting time pushing papers.” “I don’t want to do it.”\n\nEnthralling, right? Lots of excuses, but not a whole lot of DOING.\nThe goal for this week is to DO MORE GREAT WORK. I’ve already started off in the right way, by taking all of Sunday to do a bit of Life Laundry and planning for the week ahead. These organisational tasks have already helped me to re-focus, re-align, de-clutter, and get myself back under control. Regularly applied, it all comes down to SUPPORTING the GREAT WORK I’ll be doing in the weeks and months and years ahead."

Wake up at 8:52 AM.\nNo time to do grocery shopping.\nNo time to make lunch to take to uni, or no food to make lunch with.\nNo money to buy lunch.\nSurvive on water and my personal stock of coffee.\nRemember to do grocery shopping, then make lunch with bought groceries. Only have time to eat half the damn sandwich.\nPile some more shit on top of my desk at home (more like a repository for my clothes, loose change, letters, bills, etc.)\n\nThis Sunday, I plan on getting my non-uni life together. Meal plans, and a clear desk, maybe a photowalk, and finally getting to plough through my rapidly-growing “Read Later” folder. Bliss! Fo shiz."

    "text": "I’ve already past the six-month mark of my PhD and have been blogging about it all this time, over at my Tumblr. (It feels a little dirty to link to my Tumblog in the first sentence of my first WordPress post!)\nYou’re probably wondering, “After six months of PhD blogging, why the change of format?”\nIt’s more or less about separating out things according to my thoughts about what is Tumblr-friendly and what is WordPress-friendly. Though I have strayed from the model many times, I still think of my Tumblr as a place to capture snapshots: in photos, videos, songs; of short quotes and emotional responses “in the moment”. I like how the format encourages content generation straight from one’s stream of consciousness, and discourages long posts (read: posts with more than one paragraph). Both of these things are good for me; I am inclined to overthinking and rambling. On the other hand, the more I blog about my life as a PhD student, the more I find that certain pieces don’t quite fit the Tumblr mould.\nGiven the test run over the last six months, I’ve decided to launch this blog, where I will be posting more considered posts about my PhD experience. I’ll still be posting about the PhD on Tumblr, but you should know upfront that I can be highly personal, emotional and impassioned over there (often all at once). Also, as it is my personal blog, there’s plenty on there that is irrelevant to my academic pursuits. You have been forewarned 😉"
