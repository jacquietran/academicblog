    "text": "An increasing line chart showing progress and near-achievement of a 10k word count goal.\n\n\nSo close! Though I haven’t hit my 10k goal just yet, I have already started the editing process. I’m glad I’ve got another fortnight to clean up the document. Right now, it’s in what I would call a stream of consciousness format. Heh. On the other hand, I’m pretty happy with the sections I have edited, and my core concepts are holding up for the moment (only against my own scrutiny though; who knows what will happen when I submit the draft to my supervisors…).\nWord count estimates (without references):\n\nTOTAL = 8,700\nLiterature Review = 5,600\nMethodology = 2,300\nResearch Plan = 800\n\nI will admit now to the PhD Tumblr Support Group that I have breached my “four day work week” pledge from a couple weeks ago, but I just felt like I had a lot of momentum and didn’t want to break that up with a three-day weekend. Plus, in two weeks’ time, I’ll be making a trip interstate to retrieve data, meet with the co-investigators and other important individuals that will (hopefully) be involved in the research - coaches, support staff, etc. Though I’ll be bringing my netbook with me, I don’t know whether I will have the time or the appropriate facilities (such as a human-sized screen) to be getting a whole heap of writing done over that three-day period. Considering the work I will have put into my confirmation documents to that point in time, I’m not going to be too concerned if I miss a few days of writing during the trip.\nProgress!"

    "text": "I like the visual appeal of minimalism but I have trouble maintaining that same appeal in my work space. I try to combat my cluttering tendencies by deliberately choosing tools or systems that “penalise” me for not respecting clear, uncluttered space. Here’s a good example: I use Google Chrome because everything about it looks and works better when I do fewer things to the browser. I used to be a Firefox devotee, but it was too easy to hoard links in the bookmark bar, especially with the multi-row bookmark bar extension installed…\nMusic is essential. I will have usually listened to at least one song in the morning before even getting out of bed. Lately it has been “Radar Detector” by Darwin Deez, or something off the latest album by The Little Stevies. Though my drive to work is short (usually 5-10 mins), I always make sure I plug in my iPod or tune into Triple J for the journey. Music helps me focus in my shared office at uni. Even years later, I find I can recall information about tasks I have worked on if I think about what songs or artists I was listening to at the time.\nMusic is also my release. I can’t plug away every single day on the same project without rapidly losing interest and effectiveness. I am prone to bursts of motivation that can extend for a few weeks, but some days I hit a wall and just don’t have it in me. So I retreat to somewhere quiet, with as little people traffic as possible, and disappear into the comfort of music.\nI’m very organised. I don’t do anything particularly revolutionary. I’ve just learned to commit to a system that works and be prepared to change it if it doesn’t work. The bones are of my system are: a calendar, a to-do list system, and a note management program, and a back up plan. The other key characteristic of my system is that it should be as accessible as possible. I hate feeling like I am chained to do my work in any one place. Portable and internet-based applications are a natural fit; Google Calendar, Remember the Milk, Evernote, and Create Synchronicity are core applications within my system.\nI’m working on figuring out how to bridge the gap between my inclination to work like a creative while meeting the demands of academic. Current guiding concepts include:\n\nPerfect is the enemy of done.\nGet to done, then make it better.\nIf the work gets done, how the work gets done doesn’t matter to anyone else.\n\nThat last point is pretty important to me and I will readily disagree with anyone who thinks my work suffers for not conforming to M-F, 9-5 ideals. Further to that, I refuse to consistently work the ridiculous volumes of time that others do in my field, and in academia generally. I’ve tried it. The work got done, but in my eyes the method itself didn’t work. The bottom line is that extreme stress combined with one-eyed devotion to a task compromises my health, my sanity and my capacity to maintain healthy relationships. I am in the privileged position of getting to work at something I really enjoy, but I don’t love any of it enough to justify making sacrifices in my wellbeing and relationships. I’ve become better at trusting that I am good enough at what I do to decide how to create my best work."

The feeling is the same for me every time, no matter the domain, the task, the environment… Like singing in front of an audience for the first time, or teaching my first undergraduate class, or running my first true data collection sessions.\nToday, I delivered my first guest lecture. It went pretty well, I think! So now I can say that I’ve lectured to undergrads at a major Australian university. Cool but weird! Especially when I think back to being an undergrad myself, sitting in lecture theatres, trying not to fall asleep…and that was only back in 2008 :) Though it hasn’t even been three years since graduating with my Bachelor’s degree, I feel pretty far removed from that time in my life. I feel like I’ve come a long way in a short amount of time.\nOne of the really great things about continuing into postgraduate education are the opportunities that come about to get involved. There were definitely times during undergrad where I questioned whether I was learning in the best environment, studying at the best uni for my profession. But since Honours, I’ve done more fun and engaging career-related work than at any time before. Importantly, I’ve discovered that I am right where I want to be and where I should be.\nNot only is it great to be able to volunteer myself for various activities around the school, faculty, and university, but it’s so flattering to be asked to take part. I still think of myself as a lowly student, with a little knowledge but so much more to learn. I often forget that I’m already a qualified professional with valuable skills and competencies. Today was a great day and a great way to be reminded of how far I’ve come."

Lots of excuses, but not a whole lot of DOING.\nThe goal for this week is to DO MORE GREAT WORK. I’ve already started off in the right way, by taking all of Sunday to do a bit of Life Laundry and planning for the week ahead. These organisational tasks have already helped me to re-focus, re-align, de-clutter, and get myself back under control.

And aside from last week’s small hiccup (falling ill and missing two scheduled work days), I’m feeling pretty motivated, interested, and productive.\nSince I last blogged about my productivity levels, I feel like I’ve definitely improved. At the end of 2010, I felt as though I was struggling to get through 4–5 hours of productive work in a day. Now, I feel like I’m averaging 6 productive hours per day quite easily. My original intention was to schedule my days so that I wake up late (with my normal sleep cycle I wake up naturally around 8:30–9 AM) and roll up to uni at around 10 AM. Right now, my days are pretty consistently 10 AM–5 PM, though I had plans to compensate for my later start time with a later finishing time. However, I am having a bit of a struggle maintaining focus as 5 PM rolls around, as the people around me (within my office and also in the other offices nearby) begin to clock off. So I’ve been questioning my original stance, and have come to the conclusion that 10 AM–5 PM is just fine for now. Staying until 6–6:30PM for the sake of it wouldn’t achieve anything.\nWith the (mostly) lovely summer weather we’ve had over the past few weeks, I’ve also taken the liberty to wander away from my desk for short but regular breaks, and this is definitely helping me stay on task when I do sit down to work."

A couple things that have happened this week:\n\nI’ve been sleeping 10+ hours per night, and have finding it a bit more difficult than usual to wake up in the mornings. For me, this isn’t really too worrying as I am a heavy sleeper and always find it hard in the mornings (inb4 #TWSS). But my sleep behaviour this week is a little bit out of the ordinary, as I have generally been in bed before midnight, which is early for me, and don’t feel as though I am sick or exhausted or run-down in any way. I have a feeling that it’s related to a change in my training cycle this month, with more moderate- and high-intensity sessions, so it could just be my body adapting to this new cycle and recovering from training.\nThe consequence of my sleeping marathons this week was that I just didn’t spend a whole lot of time at uni. After dragging myself out of bed, having breakfast, and finally leaving home, I arrived at uni somewhere around 11 AM–12 PM every day this week. Ordinarily, I would have just extended my day at the other end, perhaps working until 7 PM or so. However, I’ve had a lot of weeknight engagements this week so I’ve been knocking off at 5ish, feeling a little guilty and unfulfilled from the small amount of work I’ve been getting through.\n\nI’m also at a stage where the work in front of me is not my favourite work…reading and annotating articles until FOREVER. It’s a necessary part of any research, but that doesn’t make it more fun for me. Like it or lump it, it’s just something I have to keep pushing myself to do.\nI’ve also had a few other things on my mind that have distracted me this week. Next week will likely be shortened as I’m roadtripping it to finish off February :) To make up for lost time, I’’’ll be dropping in tomorrow for a Friday afternoon at uni (that’s my flexible Friday coming in handy in my 4-day workweek), and may also drop in on Saturday morning as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "randomrantings (edited to remove dead links as of Dec 2024):\n\nDAY 1: Understanding feelings about writing\nAccording to Belcher, “learning to talk about writing is an important key to becoming a productive writer” (p. 2). The first step to overcoming a writer’s block/writing anxiety is to understand your relationship to writing. Hopefully you’ve picked out a paper to revise, write, or condense. Think about this particular paper. If you haven’t no worries! Think about academic writing in general! Then share with the group the answers to the following questions:\nWhat feelings come up when you think about writing? What are some negative feelings that arise? What are some positive feelings that arise?\nDon’t forget to tag your post #phd tumblr support group!\n\n\nThinking about academic writing bores me, to be honest! I am not typically intimidated or nervous about writing academic pieces, but I find it difficult to motivate myself to get going. I think most of it comes from my dislike for the formulaic process that is involved in writing scientific papers (I’m a sport scientist). I write copiously, introspectively, creatively, for my own satisfaction. On the other hand, I view academic pieces as process tasks, things that I must do to achieve a greater aim (the accumulation and then practical application of knowledge).\nBoring, tedious, extensive, time-consuming! But more than that, I feel negatively about scientific writing because it is primarily formulaic, and exceptionally passive! In my field, there is incredible overuse of terms such as: “suggests”, “implies”, “may illustrate”, “tends to”, “may explain”, etc. Of course, there is a core tenet of science which has cultivated this writing style, that nothing in science is ever “proven”. In the sport science literature, there are few who actively push the envelope to state their own thoughts and ideas. Those that do are almost always the established researchers with a significant body of work and literature behind them. But it is my opinion that even early career researchers have independent and valid thoughts, substantiated by their reading, research findings and experience, which they should be encouraged to express more assertively.\nThe formula can serve as a bit of a cheat’s way of getting started. Though specific sub-headings develop over time, I find that the generic “rationale/aims & hypotheses/methodology/results/discussion/conclusion” subheadings are, at the very least, a starting point for categorising references, as well as my own thoughts and ideas. Most of my positive feelings about academic writing come about at completion ;)"

    "text": "The Four-Day Work Week\nThis is going really well so far. Giving myself day/time limits helps to keep me focused, even when I’m not feeling “locked in”. Thursdays are my “end of working week”, so it’s never very far away, even if it’s only Monday. This time limit gives me a lot of momentum to get going, and as a result, I feel like I’m being more productive with my time. I’ve been able to meet all deadlines thus far, including the submission of two ethics applications. I am remaining aware of the fact that I don’t even know what busy really means yet, but who knows how long I’ll be able to keep up four-day work weeks during really insane periods of deadlines and external pressures? So I figure I might as well take advantage of these “quiet” periods to keep myself sane :)\nIt’s also a nice feeling to finish work for the day, because I leave it all in the office. During Honours, I worked from home a lot, which suited my night-owl body clock (wake up somewhere between 10–11 AM, get started on work at 2 PM, work until 8–10 PM), though in retrospect I did battle regularly against procrastinating activities (aka THE ENTIRE INTERNET). Now, I quite enjoy the separation of sitting at my office computer to work, and sitting on my home PC for enjoyment.\nAlso…three-day weekend, baby. Every weekend. BOOM."

I fill this time with various activities, such as short walks around campus, trotting off for coffee, chats with friends and office colleagues about nothing in particular, stretching and postural work, social media, and reading up on the news.\nI set time limits for these activities, and I stick to them, feeling refreshed and able to re-focus quickly once distraction time is over."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In these early days of my PhD, I have already gained a strong sense that I need to stay on top of information management by developing the appropriate workflow systems that will support my progress and learning over a period of years. The system needs to be flexible enough to meet the major components of the PhD (project management, databasing and data analysis, and written submissions). At the same time, it needs to be robust enough to stand up to the various demands of developing “good research”. That is to say, research that responds to, integrates with and ultimately contributes to the ever-changing, ever-growing body of knowledge; “standing on the shoulders of giants”.\nTo this end, I am pretty proud of my handiwork today. I spent the day setting up a web server and establishing a personal wiki to house my steadily growing database of notes that will be used to support writing projects throughout my PhD (e.g., literature reviews, research proposals, the thesis…). As I become more familiar with the literature, I can easily edit my wiki to reflect what I’ve read and learnt. Given its hierarchical structure, this “knowledge bank” will become increasingly useful as I approach major writing tasks. At a glance, it’s all about structure, which is a fantastic starting point for any piece of academic report writing. From there, I can follow “threads” by doing what I call “wiki-clicking”: beginning on a given topic, and clicking links on that page to a related document to broaden my knowledge of the underpinning and/or relevant areas to the original topic.\nThe workflow systems are still in development, which is to be expected as a newbie postgrad student. But establishing this wiki feels like important progress that will support the management of 3+ years of knowledge building."

    "title": "3:30-itis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my second week of coming in to uni three to four days per week, I am noticing a trend in my concentration levels. Specifically, the 3:30–4:30 PM time slot kills me. I lose focus as people around me start getting ready to close up shop for the day. However, as a late riser, I only really get going at about 10 AM, and so I arrive to the office later than others who start up at 8 AM or even earlier than that. At this early stage of my PhD, it hasn’t been detrimental to leave “early” at 4–5 PM, but I leave feeling as if I haven’t put in a full day’s work.\nA couple of things this indicates or reinforces for me:\n\nThe traditional notion of putting in 9–5, Monday to Friday, does not suit me. If keeping to my natural sleep patterns, I go to bed somewhere between 12 AM and 2 AM, and will wake up eight hours later. So my general plan is to aim to get into the office at around 10 AM, and I am hoping to average four days a week at the office / working on my PhD (with some flexibility to increase working days per week during periods leading up to important deadlines).\nOver the last two years of uni, I noticed that I was more productive at night. However, I am becoming increasingly reluctant to work from home because I feel like keeping my PhD life at uni will help me make healthy choices with regard to my time (separating time for me from time for work). During Honours, I predominantly worked from home, which suited my two daily productivity cycles, as I often pushed out a lot of my best work around 11 AM to 3 PM, and 8 PM onwards. Will have to make a compromise in this area, as my aim throughout the next three years is to manage my time well enough to get the work done in three years (and not any longer), while also having time for social activities.\nAfter spending nearly a year completely away from the academic environment, I am still getting to grips with what is required in terms of everyday mental effort. I seem to be getting about 4–5 hours of solid work out of any given day. Hopefully this will continue to improve, or else I’ll have to figure out a way to be much more efficient during my limited “focus hours”.\nI love naps, and that mid-afternoon time is prime for napping. When I worked from home during Honours, I allowed myself many afternoon naps, but it’s not an option when working from the office. Coffee doesn’t help here, so the napping difficulties may be explained by my habitual coffee drinking…\n\nAnd some potential strategies to deal with my 3.30-itis:\n\nBlock out this time to handle things that require small amounts of my concentration for short periods, e.g. responding to and organising emails, organising my workspace, updating mind maps and action plans.\nDesignate this period for physical activity: go through my stretching routine, go for a walk, etc.\nDrawing from a suggestion on the Zen Habits blog, designate this period as “distraction time” (which is what I am practising right now!). Blogging, getting up to speed across the social networks, etc."

    "title": "60-Day PhD Writing Challenge Day 2: Forming positive writing habits",
    "section": "",
    "text": "randomrantings (edited to remove dead links as of Dec 2024):\n\nDAY 2: Forming positive writing habits\n\nChoose a customary writing site. Form a habit of dedicating this space to your writing. Some have a site to prepare for writing and then another site for actually writing. Also think of a backup writing site in case your regular spot is unavailable. Make any necessary improvements to your site, like cleaning old stacks of paper off your desk, getting an ergonomic chair, etc.\nMake a writing schedule. For many of us, we fall into a permanent state of “waiting” to write as in a day on the weekend, in between classes, or that summer break. Then we sit down to write for hours upon hours. No wonder PhD writing becomes a cumbersome task!\n\n\n\nFor a few months, I was really enjoying the separation of office and home by only doing my PhD work in the office/on campus. However, I have since dubbed my office “distraction central” because it is a shared office. I’m very social, and if there are other people around, my tendency is to chat! So I’ve been spending a lot of time working from home to get through my writing tasks. (I still like the idea of separating home and work in terms of physical as well as mental space, so I think I will have to gasp become an early riser to make use of the morning hours when there isn’t anybody else around…) At home, I write in two places - either at my computer, or at my study desk with old school pen and paper.\nI’ve got a broad writing schedule for my confirmation documents, which says that my current focus should be on rustling up a second draft of my lit review/research proposal, and working on a formal oral presentation. Broadly-speaking, I am goal-driven, and my task system is reasonably well-established. As a result, I don’t reference my writing schedule very often, but as a matter of habit, I regularly drop my writing tasks right into my existing system and that seems to be working so far.\n\nKey recurring tasks include: free writing (10 mins, 1-3 times on writing days), reading and annotating articles (depending on my schedule, I aim to get through 3-6 articles in any one day), transcribing annotations into Evernote (it’s basically a lot of typing, but as a very visual person, I find it works in some sneaky way to help me remember what I’ve read), and section-specific editing.\nAlso, the days that I’m actually at uni/working on my PhD vary from week to week, because I just don’t like that kind of rigid “M-F, 9-5” structure to my schedule. I aim for four day work weeks, but with my writing deadline only one month away (yikes), I have been averaging five day work weeks and will probably bump that up to six days per week from here until the end of June. Working days can include a weekend day if it strikes me as a good opportunity (it sometimes does!), and this framework gives me the flexibility to take a day off during the traditional working week without guilt, if I feel that’s what will help me recharge. Again, with my writing deadline looming, I write or complete tasks that contribute to my writing (e.g., reading and annotating articles, mind mapping) on all working days."

    "text": "randomrantings (edited to remove dead links as of Dec 2024):\n\nDay 6: Self-reflect on Week 1; Write for at least 15 minutes\nFor today, I’d really like you to share your responses with the group if you feel comfortable.\nToday’s task: How did Week 1 really go for you?\n\nWhat successes did you have?\nWhat roadblocks did you face?\nWhat feelings arise as you look to the remaining 11 weeks?\n\n\nIt was nice to actually put “pen to paper” on the specific questions that were posed regarding our thoughts and feelings about academic writing. I’ve thought a lot about the process and chatted to many people about it, but blogging helped crystallise some things for me.\nIn particular, I had been thinking about “dumping” the work I’d done for the first draft of my lit review/research proposal, and starting afresh with a blank Word doc and the thoughts in my mind. The key part of that sentence is “had been thinking about”…I was just mulling it over in my head, not willing to take the plunge and you know, actually do it.\nI didn’t do the abstract writing task because it’s not really where my headspace is right now, though I intend to start the tasks all over again when I take on a new writing challenge in July (after my confirmation documents are done). Instead, I took the plunge and did the blank doc revision; the weekend produced 1,700+ words. Quality words, too; not an unstructured, repetitive brain dump of ideas.\nWith still a lot of work ahead of me, the lit review sits at about 2,500 good words. Due to some events external to my PhD, I’ve shifted my second draft submission date from Thursday of this week to Monday next week. That will still be a big ask but I need to press on if I am to stay on track to complete these docs by the end of June, and earn myself a roadtrip! I feel confident about the lit review, particularly with the strides I’ve made in the last week. I’m not feeling so assured about the research proposal, as I’ve been having difficulty nailing down my research questions, so that’s a demon I have to confront again this week."

Naturally.\nI’ve felt constrained by my lack of reading, the result of which is that my well of thoughts has run dry this week. I’ve lacked energy for the task because, aside from word count, I have little to indicate whether I’ve put in a good day’s work. So it’s back into the lit for me…an easily measured task, and one that will hopefully tip some fresh ideas into the well :)\nT’were it that easy, I’d be laughing! I also have to prepare for next week’s very important trip interstate. I’ll be retrieving retrospective data, presenting my proposed research direction to my project co-investigators, and asking too many questions about testing and data collection protocols.\nHonestly, I feel a bit nervous about the trip, because I feel unprepared. The trip is also being funded by two institutions so I feel the pressure to make it count. My remedy is to remind myself how well I work under pressure… ;)"

    "text": "Home on a Saturday night. * insert contented sigh here *\nThe last two weeks have been all kinds of hectic. Consequently, my body and mind are eternally grateful for this break from the madness, thank you very much. The calendar screen grab I posted last Sunday was, regrettably, accurate to how my week actually turned out. I was barely able to find time to breathe between teaching commitments, helping out an Honours student with data collection, teaching, meetings, karate, teaching, and work. And the PhD, you ask? To you sir, I say “What PhD?!” (Which is to say, I pushed my research forward by zero arbitrary research development units this week. What PhD, indeed…)\nOf course, I have paid for my insolence by waking up exhausted after two 2-hour naps today. The wurst.\n\n\n\nA dancing wurst. I wish I had the energy of this wurst. (Image from Vector Portal)\n\n\nStill, I remain grateful and excited about my PhD. It’s been 4.5 months since I started, and while I’m not where I thought I would be by now, I think things are still tracking well. Ethics approval has finally come through from my university, so we can press ahead to data retrieval and data analysis. I embraced my nerd-dom long ago, so I have no reservations in saying that this is easily the most exciting part of research. As a biomechanist-in-training, I am a data fiend. However, it can be a tenuous relationship; ask me sometime about prepping triaxial acceleration data from two measures for 500+ movement trials. Yeah. That said, working with data is still the best part of it all - it’s where the findings wait to be found, sneaky and hidden. And when they’re discovered, there’s that brief sense of a pioneer, of seeing new land on the horizon, of seeing something no one has ever seen or thought to measure.\nLater, you delve into the literature, buoyed by your groundbreaking findings, only to discover that it’s all been done. Back in 1996, even. Devo*. (This has never happened to me, clearly.) Nonetheless, that “land ho!” moment, though fleeting, is one to savour.\nBut enough rhapsodising. Saturday night is for make-shift cubby houses, a beanbag, and The Little Stevies on my iPod.\nHope you’re having a grand weekend :)\n* For the non-Australians following my blog, “devo” = devastated. Not the band."

The bones are there but I’m having trouble getting the structure right - meeting with my supervisor tomorrow, and I think his recommendation is going to be to chop the “background info” sections out completely or condense them down into one or two sentences. Sigh. Methodology section needs some refining, but it’s at about 1,500 words without really trying too hard, and having written substantially more on my first up study than studies two and three. The research plan is a pretty straightforward document that doesn’t require nearly as much clean, flowing prose as the other two components, so I’m going to try to knock that out tomorrow."

    "text": "On May 20th, I am due to submit the first draft of a 10–15,000 word written document for my confirmation of candidature. I’m sure PhD/grad programs around the world call it by many different names, so just to get us all on the same page here: confirmation is the assessment of a combined literature review and research proposal document, plus research plan (including such ever-changing details as an updated timeline for completion), plus oral presentation and possible verbal defense of your proposed research. Right now, I’m a PhD student on a provisional basis. The provision is that I meet my confirmation requirements, at which point I actually become a fully-fledged PhD candidate. It’s one of the biggest milestones in my PhD program, particularly as we don’t really have any assessments or coursework requirements at my uni (aside from the thesis itself).\nRight now, I’ve got 4,300 words down (some decent, but mostly crappy words that will probably be scrapped before the first draft is submitted). Reaching a word count is rarely an issue for me, but I definitely need to get a move on to clearly define my methodology, including the ever-daunting data and statistical analysis procedures * insert theatrical gasps here *.\nKnowing all of this, I have decided to re-instate four-day weeks into my schedule. I’ve worked on my research every weekend for the past month, which is not a pattern I want to continue. At the very least, it is important for me to have both weekend days free from uni (on average) to avoid burnout (I learnt that lesson during Honours). And, let’s be honest, life almost always seems a little bit better after a three-day weekend. Why not have that every weekend (on average)?\n\n\n\nThe real reason behind why I am re-instating four-day work weeks. Comic strip from PhDComics.com\n\n\nMaybe I’m a bit insane for choosing NOW to jump back into four-day work weeks, but I guess that insanity might explain why I’m a PhD student anyway… That said, I believe I can get the work done to an acceptable standard by setting what might seem to be a challenging limit. As I’ve mentioned before, knowing I have only four work days in a week forces me to use my time wisely and as a result I get closer to done, faster.\nHere’s the math:\n\nFour weeks until May 20th, therefore 16 work days remaining\nI’m aiming for ~12,000 words total, which means I have 8,000 words remaining.\nTo achieve that, I need to have written at least 500 “good words” (words that are going to stay in the submitted draft) each work day.\n\nTotally achievable! I’ve been doing a bit of guided free-writing lately, and I usually type out 500 words or so in ten minutes. I’m aiming to do at least three free-writing sessions per work day (that’s at least 30 minutes of solid writing), which gives me ~1,500 words to play with and edit ruthlessly. So I’m essentially banking on creating clear, original and extended thoughts at least 1/3rd of the time :) Also, I’m not beating myself up about the quality of the prose (yet); after all, it’s only a first draft. I just want to make sure that my writing tells a cohesive story, and if the bones are there I can worry about making it pretty in the following drafts."

    "text": "Fortunate enough to know what work I want to do. Fortunate to be in a position (financially, socioeconomically, and educationally speaking) where I can pursue, on a full-time basis, work that engages me. Fortunate to be good enough at this work to meet my personal standards. Most days, I feel awfully lucky to be in the position I am in.\nBut something that has confused me for a long time is the way I can feel so passionately about two very different streams in my life: 1) my creative pursuits, and 2) my work as a developing sport scientist. In my mind, I’ve always separated out these two supposedly disparate branches, without really giving thought to the opportunities for the two to come together and create something even greater. Because really, how natural does it feel to think about music and sport, compared to music or sport?\nAt 15 or 16, I decided sport science was what I wanted to do. I came to the realisation that sport science was an area of study that I found intellectually-stimulating, socially-relevant, and aligned with my interest and involvement in sports. A part of me also concluded that chasing this dream meant giving up another. You know that dream so many of us have of becoming rock stars? Or in my case, a songwriter, or composer, or session musician, or simply a music-maker by any other name? I gave up on those distant possibilities to set sail towards becoming a sport scientist. It’s not a decision I made lightly, but also not a decision I’ve ever regretted because I always saw my dual passions as mutually exclusive. I knew that, one day, I would have to choose one favourite between my two children, so to speak ;)\nNow at 22 and wading through the early stages of a PhD in sports performance analysis, I am starting to make the mental link between my life as a scientist and a student, and my life as a creative. Almost everyday, and certainly every week, I am learning more about how I learn. And in every instance, the relationship between my creative side and my scientific side becomes clearer. I am now beginning to conceptualise the co-existence of my two great loves.\nAt this stage, the lean is towards how my creative side supports and actually underpins most all of the academic work I do. (Consequently, it makes me excited that I might someday figure out how my scientific and scholarly pursuits inform me as a creative!) I am establishing systems to support my achievement of Great Work. What I am noticing is my blatant attraction to that which can help me complete Great Work efficiently, while also being visually stunning, creatively inspiring, and emotionally connected to my self-concept.\nI also find that I am becoming less interested in what people in my own field do to become (or be considered) “successful”. More often, I gravitate towards the stories and journeys of writers, poets, designers, painters, musicians, photographers. I relate far more to these artists, these observers of the human spirit and condition, than I do to your typical straight-line, no-nonsense scholar or academic.\nMore on specific workflows and inspirations in blog posts to come, but I just felt compelled to write about what I feel is an emerging relationship between my personal artistry and scientific study. Consider it the influence of my muse dropping by for a late night visit. :)"

I decided to leave content out entirely for those sections rather than copy and paste from my first draft because the blank doc approach has been working really super well for the flow in my writing. Also, my first draft was more like a shit review…this draft is in far better shape, and I know the currently blank sections will be better if I take the time to respect the story I am trying to tell.\nAiming to have the second draft of my research proposal to them by Friday. Still pressing for an end of June final deadline for the document, though a part of me has been thinking that it is unlikely because it doesn’t give my supervisors enough time to read my drafts and give feedback. Normally, I allow for a two to three week waiting period for draft feedback, but if I want this doc done by the end of June then I don’t have that leeway.\nTeam meeting tomorrow; we shall see what the big wigs have to say!

(protip: click that link…“The Thesis Whisperer” is one of my favourite PhD blogs!)\nStill, my distaste for the quality of my first draft was getting in the way of me making decent changes for my second draft. Something told me I would be happier with a blank file and starting my writing again “from scratch” (in a new file). But I was having trouble detaching myself from the work I’d already done, until I briefly caught up with my dear friend Gill, who always tells it to me straight. I told her of my blank paper plan (that had not yet been acted upon). Her (paraphrased) response? “So just do it. You’re not really dumping the work you’ve already done…”\nToday I did it. I opened up Word, started with a fresh new file, and copied over only my headings and subheadings from section one of my lit review. It took me the whole day, but now I have section one written and out of the way and I’m really happy with it. I’m only wishing now that I’d been brave enough to do this a week ago! You live, you learn :)\nAt this stage, I’m aiming to submit the second draft on Thursday to le supervisors, which will definitely be challenging. I may need to extend that deadline so I can do justice to the research proposal as well."

It can be a new manuscript/revision/thesis/dissertation chapter/lit review, etc. Be sure that the writing project you choose will have a definable end point such as complete article, chapter, or a certain number of words so that you can feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the 12 weeks.\nDecide a reward for yourself at the end of the 12 weeks for if you complete the challenge.\nDecide a fee if you do not meet your writing goal by the end of the 12 weeks.\n\nHere are my responses:\n\nI’ve been working on my confirmation documents (literature review, research proposal, research plan, oral presentation, verbal defense) since early April. I’m aiming to have them completed and ready for submission/presentation by June 30. After June 30, I’ll decide on a new writing piece to begin work on - probably the first draft of a thesis chapter :)\nReward at June 30 if goal is met: July road trip! 3-4 days away from it all :)\nFee if goal is not met at June 30: No “lie-ins” for a week. This happens basically every morning where I wake up and lie in bed for 30–60 mins, indulging my laziness. I enjoy it, but it definitely gets in the way of getting things done sometimes! And having to relinquish this joyous activity as a potential fee will be a strong extrinsic motivator for me, because boy oh boy do I like my bed… #unintentionallydirty\n\nBring on Monday: Day 1!"

(It feels a little dirty to link to my Tumblog in the first sentence of my first WordPress post!)\nYou’re probably wondering, “After six months of PhD blogging, why the change of format?”\nIt’s more or less about separating out things according to my thoughts about what is Tumblr-friendly and what is WordPress-friendly. Though I have strayed from the model many times, I still think of my Tumblr as a place to capture snapshots: in photos, videos, songs; of short quotes and emotional responses “in the moment”. I like how the format encourages content generation straight from one’s stream of consciousness, and discourages long posts (read: posts with more than one paragraph). Both of these things are good for me; I am inclined to overthinking and rambling. On the other hand, the more I blog about my life as a PhD student, the more I find that certain pieces don’t quite fit the Tumblr mould.\nGiven the test run over the last six months, I’ve decided to launch this blog, where I will be posting more considered posts about my PhD experience. I’ll still be posting about the PhD on Tumblr, but you should know upfront that I can be highly personal, emotional and impassioned over there (often all at once). Also, as it is my personal blog, there’s plenty on there that is irrelevant to my academic pursuits. You have been forewarned 😉"

    "text": "I follow a few blogs that I’ve categorised as “productivity + lifehacks” resources, and while I sometimes find general tips and tricks useful, what I really love to learn about is how specific people work in their specific circumstances.\nI’ve been meaning to write about my own work flows for a few months now, but the post has been sitting in my drafts untouched. I felt compelled to finally get to it after reading about how Tumblr’s David Karp works. With the idea fermenting in my head for so long, I have now written words for days…so I’m splitting it into parts! It also gives me an excuse to test the Tumblr queue to see if they got that old dog working again…\nI am a sport scientist by profession, but I wear many guises on any given day depending on the projects I am actively involved in: PhD student, research assistant, tutor/teacher, conditioning coach, corrective exercise practitioner, client communications representative. My work essentially comprises and is supported by two key components: my creative background as a musician, some-time stage performer and hobby graphic designer, and the academic skills I’ve developed over recent years.\nI’m very visually-inclined; I learn and work best when I get to see something either in progress or from start to finish. As you might expect from being heavily involved in sport, I am regularly learning about different, interesting ways to move or measure movement. In this context, I like to see an expert or skilled performer doing the task first, but then my kinaesthetic sense takes over and I like to move quickly from a demonstration to replicating the performance myself. I think it helps to watch complex movements in their entirety, but this might be influenced by what I’ve read about in coaching and motor learning literature.\nThough this is my fifth year of tertiary studies in sport science, I feel like I still learn something new on a daily or at least weekly basis, which I think is a great blessing for me as my interest in anything wanes quickly if I don’t see or feel progress.\nI like bright colours. I’m the kid that purchases the multi-colour sticky notes over the traditional yellow pads. I have a shoebox full of colour markers. I think it’s mostly because I am highly visual. But I’ve also thought that it might be a reaction to the “black text on white paper, Times New Roman, 12 pt, double spaced” world of academic submissions.\nThis year, I’ve been trying my hand at sketchnoting. I’m not great at linear thinking on-the-fly, so I love the freedom it gives me to just think without feeling bound to structure. Class notebook-style lines remind me of linearity, so my favourite notebooks are either unlined or gridded. Drawing notes instead of writing them is also super fun! It gives me a great reason to carry a handful of coloured textas with me for “work”."
